Twitter Sentiment Analytics using Apache Spark Streaming APIs and Python

In this project, it is about processing live data streams using Spark’s streaming APIs
and Python and performing a basic sentiment analysis of realtime
tweets. In addition, learning basic Apache Kafka, which is a queuing service for data
streams.

twitterStream.py writes and plots the running total count of the number of positive and
negative words that have been tweeted.
